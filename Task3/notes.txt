 Interactive User-Guided Colorization Description: Create a model that allows users to interactively control the colorization process. Users should be able to select specific sections of an image and define the colors they want, which the model will subsequently use to impact the overall colorization of the image. Guidelines: The GUI should allow users to upload photographs, select locations, and set color preferences. The model should dynamically change the colorization based on user input, resulting in a highly personalized colorization experience.
